Given Information: It is stated that Lisa lost 21 pounds, so weight_lost = 21.\n\n4. Set Up the Equation: Equate the weight lost expressions: 0.12 * x = 21.\n\n5. Solve for x: Divide by 0.12 on both sides to find Lisa's original weight: x = 21 / 0.12 = 175.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nDecision: Right", "check/answer/eot/flag": 1, "check/final/eot/flag": 1}
